# brightness_adjust

This is a command-line tool to show a selection of darker/lighter variants of a given colour.

<img src="./screenshot_yellow.png" alt="A terminal window running the command 'brightness_adjust #e9a924', followed by different shades of the same colour, ranging from dark to light.">

I use it when there's a specific hue/saturation I want to use (e.g. chosen by [dominant_colours]), but it's too dark or light to use in a particular context.

For example, in the screenshot above, I have a bright shade of yellow `#e9a924`.
This is too bright to be readable against a white background -- but I have a range of similar colours I can use in its place.
